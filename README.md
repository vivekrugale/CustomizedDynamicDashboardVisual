# CustomizedDynamicDashboardVisual

A customized and dynamic dashboard visual was created in web using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As per the requirement, the dashboard adjusts its dimensions dynamically according to the data content it has. This functionality is implemented using CSS Grid and Flex properties. The dashboard is also synced with the data source so that any changes in the data source would also reflect in the dashboard in real time. JavaScript is used to access the data source, process the data and display it in the dashboard visual.

IMP - Here all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code is written in the same HTML file as that was the requirement during the project. It is always the best practice to seperate out the CSS and JS files and refer them in the HTML file. But as we further wanted to render the code in a BI software, it is written in a single file.
